<a href="https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI">InvokeAI</a> is an
implementation of Stable Diffusion, the open source text-to-image and
image-to-image generator. It provides a streamlined process with
various new features and options to aid the image generation
process. It runs on Windows, Mac and Linux machines, and runs on GPU
cards with as little as 4 GB or RAM.

## :octicons-package-dependencies-24: Installation

This fork is supported across multiple platforms. You can find individual installation instructions
below.

- :fontawesome-brands-linux: [Linux](installation/INSTALL_LINUX.md)
- :fontawesome-brands-windows: [Windows](installation/INSTALL_WINDOWS.md)
- :fontawesome-brands-apple: [Macintosh](installation/INSTALL_MAC.md)

## :fontawesome-solid-computer: Hardware Requirements

### :octicons-cpu-24: System

You wil need one of the following:

- :simple-nvidia: An NVIDIA-based graphics card with 4 GB or more VRAM memory.
- :fontawesome-brands-apple: An Apple computer with an M1 chip.

### :fontawesome-solid-memory: Memory

- At least 12 GB Main Memory RAM.

### :fontawesome-regular-hard-drive: Disk

- At least 12 GB of free disk space for the machine learning model, Python, and all its dependencies.

!!! info

    If you are have a Nvidia 10xx series card (e.g. the 1080ti), please run the invoke script in
    full-precision mode as shown below.

    Similarly, specify full-precision mode on Apple M1 hardware.

    Precision is auto configured based on the device. If however you encounter errors like 
    `expected type Float but found Half` or `not implemented for Half` you can try starting 
    `invoke.py` with the `--precision=float32` flag:

    ```bash
    (invokeai) ~/InvokeAI$ python scripts/invoke.py --full_precision
    ```

## :octicons-log-16: Latest Changes

### v2.0.1 <small>(13 October 2022)</small>

- fix noisy images at high step count when using k* samplers
- dream.py script now calls invoke.py module directly rather than
  via a new python process (which could break the environment)

### v2.0.0 <small>(9 October 2022)</small>

- `dream.py` script renamed `invoke.py`. A `dream.py` script wrapper remains
  for backward compatibility.
- Completely new WebGUI - launch with `python3 scripts/invoke.py --web`
- Support for <a href="https://invoke-ai.github.io/InvokeAI/features/INPAINTING/">inpainting</a> and <a href="https://invoke-ai.github.io/InvokeAI/features/OUTPAINTING/">outpainting</a>
- img2img runs on all k* samplers
- Support for <a href="https://invoke-ai.github.io/InvokeAI/features/PROMPTS/#negative-and-unconditioned-prompts">negative prompts</a>
- Support for CodeFormer face reconstruction
- Support for Textual Inversion on Macintoshes
- Support in both WebGUI and CLI for <a href="https://invoke-ai.github.io/InvokeAI/features/POSTPROCESS/">post-processing of previously-generated images</a>
  using facial reconstruction, ESRGAN upscaling, outcropping (similar to DALL-E infinite canvas),
  and "embiggen" upscaling. See the `!fix` command.
- New `--hires` option on `invoke>` line allows <a href="https://invoke-ai.github.io/InvokeAI/features/CLI/#txt2img">larger images to be created without duplicating elements</a>, at the cost of some performance.
- New `--perlin` and `--threshold` options allow you to add and control variation
  during image generation (see <a href="https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI/blob/main/docs/features/OTHER.md#thresholding-and-perlin-noise-initialization-options">Thresholding and Perlin Noise Initialization</a>
- Extensive metadata now written into PNG files, allowing reliable regeneration of images
  and tweaking of previous settings.
- Command-line completion in `invoke.py` now works on Windows, Linux and Mac platforms.
- Improved <a href="https://invoke-ai.github.io/InvokeAI/features/CLI/">command-line completion behavior</a>.
  New commands added:
  - List command-line history with `!history`
  - Search command-line history with `!search`
  - Clear history with `!clear`
- Deprecated `--full_precision` / `-F`. Simply omit it and `invoke.py` will auto
  configure. To switch away from auto use the new flag like `--precision=float32`.

For older changelogs, please visit the **[CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md#v114-11-september-2022)**.

## :octicons-repo-push-24: Contributing

Anyone who wishes to contribute to this project, whether documentation, features, bug fixes, code
cleanup, testing, or code reviews, is very much encouraged to do so. If you are unfamiliar with how
to contribute to GitHub projects, here is a
[Getting Started Guide](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github).

A full set of contribution guidelines, along with templates, are in progress, but for now the most
important thing is to **make your pull request against the "development" branch**, and not against
"main". This will help keep public breakage to a minimum and will allow you to propose more radical
changes.
