# :octicons-paintbrush-16: Installing Models

## Model Weight Files

The model weight files ('*.ckpt') are the Stable Diffusion "secret
sauce". They are the product of training the AI on millions of
captioned images gathered from multiple sources.

Originally there was only a single Stable Diffusion weights file,
which many people named `model.ckpt`. Now there are dozens or more
that have been "fine tuned" to provide particulary styles, genres, or
other features. InvokeAI allows you to install and run multiple model
weight files and switch between them quickly in the command-line and
web interfaces.

This manual will guide you through installing and configuring model
weight files.

## Base Models

InvokeAI comes with support for a good initial set of models listed in
the model configuration file `configs/models.yaml`. They are:

| Model                   | Weight File                   |   Description                    | DOWNLOAD FROM            |
| ----------------------  | ----------------------------- |--------------------------------- | ----------------|
| stable-diffusion-1.5    | v1-5-pruned-emaonly.ckpt      | Most recent version of base Stable Diffusion model| https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5 |
| stable-diffusion-1.4    | sd-v1-4.ckpt                  | Previous version of base Stable Diffusion model | https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v-1-4-original |
| inpainting-1.5          | sd-v1-5-inpainting.ckpt       | Stable Diffusion 1.5 model specialized for inpainting | https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-inpainting |
| waifu-diffusion-1.3     | model-epoch09-float32.ckpt    | Stable Diffusion 1.4 trained to produce anime images | https://huggingface.co/hakurei/waifu-diffusion-v1-3 |
| <all models>            | vae-ft-mse-840000-ema-pruned.ckpt   | A fine-tune file add-on file that improves face generation | https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sd-vae-ft-mse-original/ |


Note that these files are covered by an "Ethical AI" license which
forbids certain uses. You will need to create an account on the
Hugging Face website and accept the license terms before you can
access the files.

The predefined configuration file for InvokeAI (located at
`configs/models.yaml`) provides entries for each of these weights
files. `stable-diffusion-1.5` is the default model used, and we
strongly recommend that you install this weights file if nothing else.

## Community-Contributed Models

There are too many to list here and more are being contributed every
day. Hugging Face maintains a [fast-growing
repository](https://huggingface.co/sd-concepts-library) of fine-tune
(".bin") models that can be imported into InvokeAI by passing the
`--embedding_path` option to the `invoke.py` command.

[This page](https://rentry.org/sdmodels) hosts a large list of
official and unofficial Stable Diffusion models and where they can be
obtained.

## Installation

There are three ways to install weights files:

1. During InvokeAI installation, the `preload_models.py` script can
download them for you.

2. You can use the command-line interface (CLI) to import, configure
and modify new models files.

3. You can download the files manually and add the appropriate entries
to `models.yaml`.

### Installation via `preload_models.py`

This is the most automatic way. Run `scripts/preload_models.py` from
the console.  It will ask you to select which models to download and
lead you through the steps of setting up a Hugging Face account if you
haven't done so already.

To start, from within the InvokeAI directory run the command `python
scripts/preload_models.py` (Linux/MacOS) or `python
scripts\preload_models.py` (Windows):

```

** LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR WEIGHT FILES **

1. To download the Stable Diffusion weight files you need to read and accept the
   CreativeML Responsible AI license. If you have not already done so, please 
   create an account using the "Sign Up" button:

   https://huggingface.co 

   You will need to verify your email address as part of the HuggingFace
   registration process.

2. After creating the account, login under your account and accept
   the license terms located here:

   https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v-1-4-original

Press <enter> when you are ready to continue:
...
```

When the script is complete, you will find the downloaded weights
files in `models/ldm/stable-diffusion-v1` and a matching configuration
file in `configs/models.yaml`.

You can run the script again to add any models you didn't select the
first time. Note that as a safety measure the script will _never_
remove a previously-installed weights file. You will have to do this
manually.

### Installation via the CLI

You can install a new model, including any of the community-supported
ones, via the command-line client's `!import_model` command.

1. First download the desired model weights file and place it under `models/ldm/stable-diffusion-v1/`.
   You may rename the weights file to something more memorable if you wish. Record the path of the
   weights file (e.g. `models/ldm/stable-diffusion-v1/arabian-nights-1.0.ckpt`)

2. Launch the `invoke.py` CLI with `python scripts/invoke.py`.

3. At the `invoke>` command-line, enter the command `!import_model <path to model>`.
   For example:

   `invoke> !import_model models/ldm/stable-diffusion-v1/arabian-nights-1.0.ckpt`

   (Hint - the CLI supports file path autocompletion. Type a bit of the path
   name and hit <tab> in order to get a choice of possible completions.)

4. Follow the wizard's instructions to complete installation as shown in the example
   here:

```
invoke> <b>!import_model models/ldm/stable-diffusion-v1/arabian-nights-1.0.ckpt</b>
>> Model import in process. Please enter the values needed to configure this model:

Name for this model: <b>arabian-nights</b>
Description of this model: <b>Arabian Nights Fine Tune v1.0</b>
Configuration file for this model: <b>configs/stable-diffusion/v1-inference.yaml</b>
Default image width: <b>512</b>
Default image height: <b>512</b>
>> New configuration:
arabian-nights:
  config: configs/stable-diffusion/v1-inference.yaml
  description: Arabian Nights Fine Tune v1.0
  height: 512
  weights: models/ldm/stable-diffusion-v1/arabian-nights-1.0.ckpt
  width: 512
OK to import [n]? <b>y</b>
>> Caching model stable-diffusion-1.4 in system RAM
>> Loading waifu-diffusion from models/ldm/stable-diffusion-v1/arabian-nights-1.0.ckpt
   | LatentDiffusion: Running in eps-prediction mode
   | DiffusionWrapper has 859.52 M params.
   | Making attention of type 'vanilla' with 512 in_channels
   | Working with z of shape (1, 4, 32, 32) = 4096 dimensions.
   | Making attention of type 'vanilla' with 512 in_channels
   | Using faster float16 precision

```

If you've previously installed the fine-tune VAE file `vae-ft-mse-840000-ema-pruned.ckpt`,
the wizard will also ask you if you want to add this VAE to the model.

The appropriate entry for this model will be added to `configs/models.yaml` and it will
be available to use in the CLI immediately.

The CLI has additional commands for switching among, viewing, editing,
deleting the available models. These are described in [Command Line
Client](../features/CLI.md#model-selection-and-importation), but the two most
frequently-used are `!models` and `!switch <name of model>`. The first
prints a table of models that InvokeAI knows about and their load
status. The second will load the requested model and lets you switch
back and forth quickly among loaded models.

### Manually editing of `configs/models.yaml`

If you are comfortable with a text editor then you may simply edit
`models.yaml` directly.

First you need to download the desired .ckpt file and place it in
`models/ldm/stable-diffusion-v1` as descirbed in step #1 in the
previous section. Record the path to the weights file,
e.g. `models/ldm/stable-diffusion-v1/arabian-nights-1.0.ckpt`

Then using a **text** editor (e.g. the Windows Notepad application),
open the file `configs/models.yaml`, and add a new stanza that follows
this model:

```
arabian-nights-1.0:
  description: A great fine-tune in Arabian Nights style
  weights: ./models/ldm/stable-diffusion-v1/arabian-nights-1.0.ckpt
  config: ./configs/stable-diffusion/v1-inference.yaml
  width: 512
  height: 512
  vae: ./models/ldm/stable-diffusion-v1/vae-ft-mse-840000-ema-pruned.ckpt
  default: false
```

* arabian-nights-1.0
  - This is the name of the model that you will refer to from within the
  CLI and the WebGUI when you need to load and use the model.

* description
  - Any description that you want to add to the model to remind you what
    it is.

* weights
  - Relative path to the .ckpt weights file for this model.

* config
  - This is the confusingly-named configuration file for the model itself.
  Use `./configs/stable-diffusion/v1-inference.yaml` unless the model happens
  to need a custom configuration, in which case the place you downloaded it
  from will tell you what to use instead. For example, the runwayML custom
  inpainting model requires the file `configs/stable-diffusion/v1-inpainting-inference.yaml`.
  This is already inclued in the InvokeAI distribution and is configured automatically
  for you by the `preload_models.py` script.

* vae
  - If you want to add a VAE file to the model, then enter its path here.

* width, height
  - This is the width and height of the images used to train the model.
  Currently they are always 512 and 512.

Save the `models.yaml` and relaunch InvokeAI. The new model should now be
available for your use.
